/**
 * A registry for converting implementation-dependent game resources to their unique IDs.
 * <p>
 * In general, IDs should be considered arbitrary integers. They must not be persisted unless sufficient care is taken to ensure that all data is invalidated when the ID mappings
 * are changed (see {@link #registryToken()}). However, implementations must respect the following rules when assigning IDs:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>IDs must never be negative. If more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} IDs would be required, an exception should be thrown when constructing the registry.</li>
 *     <li>The ID {@code 0} is always valid. For biomes, it may be assigned to any valid biome. For states, it must always be assigned to air.</li>
 *     <li>IDs should be allocated in a mostly sequential order. They do not necessarily have to be tightly packed, but users should be able to use them as simple array
 *     indices without wasting too much memory.</li>
 * </ul>
