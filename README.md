This is a Minecraft mod which implements a Level-of-Detail (LoD) terrain renderer into the game.
The name is in reference to [Foghrye4's CWGFarPlaneView](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cwg-far-plane-view), which is an addon for CubicWorldGen (which, in turn, is an addon for Cubic Chunks) which renders a plane at sea level with block and biome colors, and served as the original inspiration for me to make this.
**This mod is a work in progress! If you do decide to download this, don't expect stuff to work correctly because it probably won't.**

**Remember to [Read the FAQ first](https://github.com/PorkStudios/FarPlaneTwo/wiki/FAQ)**!

## Installation
*This is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.12.2. Other versions WILL be supported in the future.*
1) Install [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for Minecraft 1.12.2.
2) [Download](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/PorkStudios/job/FarPlaneTwo/job/master/) the mod.
3) Download these dependencies too:
   - [ForgeRocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgerocks)
   - [Mixin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-0-7-0-8-compatibility)

For best results use cubic chunks and cubic world gen and set the world type to custom cubic.

(Cubic Chunks bundles Mixin inside it, so don't use both cubic chunks and mixin together.)

   - [Cubic World Gen](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/OpenCubicChunks/job/CubicWorldGen/)

Some of the above pages should look a lot like this:

There can be a lot of links on these pages. Click on the first one underneath "Last Successful Artifacts".


## Goals and Motivations

My end goal is to achieve the following:

- be able to use render distances of *at least* 100 thousand blocks
- cause at most a 25% decrease in performance when using my i5-2520M's integrated graphics
- be compatible with [Cubic Chunks](https://github.com/OpenCubicChunks/CubicChunks)
- be as compatible as reasonably possible with other mods

At some point (once the internals of the mod are more polished) I'll probably write up a big section here describing exactly how a lot of the stuff works.
